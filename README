Project Report
------------------
Requirement:

The project required us to develop a token-based mutual exclusion model using Suzuki/Kasami algorithm.


Implementation:

The project required us to pass the token between clients where the token was served to the client when it requested. Token request was made my multicasting a sequence vector. The clients recieved multicasted requests frm other clients and updated their own vector (which was their best knowledge about others). The token was assumed to be with client 1 initially. Once request messages are recieved, the token queue is updated by the client who has the token. If it had requested and obtained the token, it also updates the token vector indicating that its request was served. A client can not make another request until its first request was served.

The code was written carefully handling each unique case as per the specification. The Start.java initiates the clients on remote machines and ends. The skb.java program initiates three threads - one for multicasting requests, one for recieveing the requests. The third one handles token passing or recieveing based on the client's status and sends the token in a unicast fashin by establishing a socket with that client (obtaines as first element of the queue). The output request.log is printed by the last client checking if all other clients were served. The output is carried by a string attached to the token and written to output file by the last client who was served.
